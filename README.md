# Auto-labelling-mechanism-for-texts-and-emails

### Introduction:
You are tasked with developing an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) system for automatically labeling unstructured text data, specifically focusing on text messages and emails. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate mechanism that can categorize similar messages without the need for pre-labeling.

## Requirements:

Data Collection:
Gather a diverse dataset of text messages and emails, ensuring a mix of formal and informal communication.
The dataset should be unlabelled to simulate real-world scenarios.

### Preprocessing:
Implement robust text preprocessing techniques to handle noise, irrelevant content, and variations in writing styles.
Consider handling common challenges such as misspellings, abbreviations, and emojis.

### Auto-Labeling Mechanism:
Develop a machine learning model utilizing NLP techniques for auto-labeling.
Explore and compare different algorithms, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or a combination of both.
Investigate methods like clustering or topic modeling to identify patterns in the unlabelled data.

### Similarity Measurement:
Implement a method to measure the similarity between messages, allowing the system to group them based on content.
Experiment with techniques like cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, or other suitable metrics.

### Active Learning:
Integrate an active learning strategy to continually improve the model over time.
Implement mechanisms for users or administrators to provide feedback on the accuracy of the auto-labeling system.

### Scalability:
Ensure the system can handle large volumes of data efficiently.
Explore parallel processing or distributed computing to enhance scalability.

### Integration with Email Systems:
Develop a module to seamlessly integrate with popular email systems.
The system should be able to process emails, extract relevant text, and apply the auto-labeling mechanism.
